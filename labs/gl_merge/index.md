# Use GitLab to merge code

In this lab, you'll: 

* Create a new project
* Create a new issue 
* Create a merge request and branch
* Edit files in the branch
* Review the code 
* Merge the branch and close the merge request

You have completed similar steps in previous labs, so this will not be a step-by-step guide. Work on accomplishing the objectives on your own. The instructor will walk through the lab solution after the allotted lab time.

## Objectives

* Create a new private project named `Second Project`

* Create a new issue and assign it to yourself. 

* Create a new branch, edit the `README.md` file, and commit the changes

* Review the code, and merge it to the `main` branch.
